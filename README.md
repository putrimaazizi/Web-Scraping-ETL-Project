### Web-Scraping-ETL-Project
Project Overview

This project was created as part of the Comprehensive Data Analytics Bootcamp (Phase 0) to demonstrate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline process.
The goal of this project is to extract product data from an e-commerce website, clean and transform the data using Python and Pandas, and finally load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.
